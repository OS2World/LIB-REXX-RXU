RXU is a rich set of Rexx functions which expose most of the OS/2 API set to
Rexx programs (memory management/access, semaphores, pipes, queues, module handling,
threading/tasking, system information, i/o, devioctl, etc.), as well as providing
many functions which aid in Rexx programming (variable pool access, "expose" variables
across external function calls, queue manipulation, macrospace management, etc.).

Package includes .INF file and sample Rexx programs and the source code.
